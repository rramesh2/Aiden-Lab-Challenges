----bucket_challenge.py----

--Command Line Arguments--
For passing command-line arguments, requires the argument to be a string, so that, if one wanted to pass in the argument [1, 2, 3] for the bucket sizes and 2 for the target size, one would have to use:

python bucket_challenge.py "[1, 2, 3]" "2"
